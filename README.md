DNS TXT records for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC — portfolio project in email deliverability  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository demonstrates the technical setup for improving **email deliverability** using three key DNS authentication records:  

- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** – defines which mail servers are allowed to send emails for this domain.  
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** – uses cryptographic signatures to verify that emails haven’t been tampered with.  
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)** – provides instructions to receiving mail servers on how to handle messages that fail SPF/DKIM checks.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
Email deliverability is a core skill for SaaS email marketing roles. This project shows that I can:  
1. Configure DNS TXT records correctly.  
2. Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC alignment.  
3. Use modern tools to improve inbox placement.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Services  
- GitHub Pages (for domain hosting)  
- DNS TXT record configuration  
- Online testing tools like **MxToolbox** and **Google Postmaster Tools**  

## ✅ Deliverables  
- Example SPF record  
- Example DKIM public key  
- Example DMARC record with policy and reporting address  

## 🔗 Next Steps  
This repository will later include screenshots of record validation tests and reports from deliverability tools.
